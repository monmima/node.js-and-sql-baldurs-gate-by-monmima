# Baldur's Gate Portraits with Node.js + SQL

This project is based on my [node-and-sql-aide-memoire-by-monmima](https://github.com/monmima/node-and-sql-aide-memoire-by-monmima), which is itself based on different other things (see the aide-m√©moire README file for more info).

I created yet another project based on Baldur's Gate Characters and portraits because there is a wealth of material to work from (standardized character portraits easily available, character descriptions), etc., and because I had a basic database I created earlier to work from.
